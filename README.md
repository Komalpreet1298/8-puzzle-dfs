# ðŸ§© 8-Puzzle Solver using Depth-First Search (DFS)

## ðŸ“Œ Aim
The aim of this project is to implement a **Depth-First Search (DFS)** algorithm to solve the **8-puzzle problem**.
The program finds a path from a given **start state** to the **goal state** by exploring all possible moves systematically.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
The **8-puzzle problem** consists of a 3x3 grid with tiles numbered `1â€“8` and one empty space (denoted by `0`).  
The objective is to **move the tiles** by sliding them into the empty space until the puzzle matches the **goal configuration**:


Given an initial state from the user, the program must:
1. Traverse the puzzle states using **DFS**.  
2. Record all visited states.  
3. Print the traversal order.  
4. Reconstruct and display the **final path** from start to goal.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Algorithm Used: Depth-First Search (DFS)

1. **Start with the initial state** and push it onto a stack.  
2. While the stack is not empty:  
   - Pop the top state.  
   - If the state has already been visited, skip it.  
   - Mark the state as visited.  
   - If it matches the goal state, terminate and reconstruct the path.  
   - Otherwise, generate all possible child states (by sliding the blank tile).  
   - Push unvisited child states onto the stack.  
3. If the stack becomes empty without reaching the goal, return **no solution**.

## ðŸ“Œ Time and Space Complexity

### Time Complexity:
- In the worst case, DFS may explore **all possible states** of the 8-puzzle.  
- The total number of unique states = **9! = 362,880**.  
- Worst-case time complexity: **O(b^d)**  
  - where `b` = branching factor (â‰¤ 4)  
  - `d` = depth of the solution.  

### Space Complexity:
- DFS uses a stack for storing states and a `closed set` for visited states.  
- Worst-case space complexity: **O(bÂ·d)**, which is generally lower than BFS.
